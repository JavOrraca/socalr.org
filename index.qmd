Welcome to the Southern California R Users Group (SoCal RUG)! Since no single group can serve this sprawling area, several RUGs from Santa Barbara to San Diego joined forces to centralize SoCal-based R events and information.

In addition to our core SoCal RUG team, our archive includes events hosted by our extended R alliance including the following groups: [R-Ladies Irvine](https://www.rladiesirvine.org/), [R-Ladies Los Angeles](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-la/), [R-Ladies Pasadena](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-pasadena/), [R-Ladies Riverside](https://rladies.github.io/riverside/), [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/), [R-Ladies San Diego](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-san-diego/), [Central Coast RUG](https://www.meetup.com/central-coast-r-users-group/), and [useR Group in San Luis Obispo County](https://www.meetup.com/useR-Group-in-San-Luis-Obispo-County/).
